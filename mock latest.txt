Which statements are true about the Scanner class?
Select the 3 correct answers.
Multiple Choice - This may have multiple correct answers. Select required answer(s) from the options list.
The Scanner class has constructors that can accept the following as an argument: a String, a StringBuffer, a StringBuilder, a File, an InputStream, a Reader.
